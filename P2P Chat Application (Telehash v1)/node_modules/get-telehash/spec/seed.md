Seeding
=======

All Switches on startup must seed themselves within the DHT.  They should have a list of well known and/or cached IPPs to seed from.

Seeding consists primarily of first discovering your public IP:PORT (via a response To value) and then Dialing your own End to fill your Buckets with other Switches near you.
